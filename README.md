# Booking service api

As asked in assignment i provided incomplete solution with comments how it can be better. 
The application and tests are all set up and ready to run.
Before the first startup it is recommended to run **mvn clean** then **mvn install** to
ensure mapper implementation will generated correctly.


On startup in-memory instance of h2 will run. 
You can access the db console by this path: **http://localhost:8080/h2-console** 
and connect to the db using credentials from **application-properties**.

For convenient testing i provided a postman collection located at **resource** directory.
